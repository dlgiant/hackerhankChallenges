# Algorithm explanation

1. Make a matrix with length - 2 of original
2. Use the leftmost index of HourGlass as starting point
3. Iterate over original matrix excluding 2+ index up and down so we don't get out of bounds
4. Hardcode format of HourGlass that will be iterated
5. Stored results for each sum in new matrix find max value in new matrix and return it
