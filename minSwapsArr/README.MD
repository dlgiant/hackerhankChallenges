# Algorithm used
1. Iterate over array using index and current value
2. If current index+1 is not the same as the current value the value is in incorrect position
3. Iterate again to find the value that should be in that position and hold the index, break from loop when find it
4. Swap elements and count up by 1 the swaps
5. Return swaps
